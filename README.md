# Pre-Op Triage Take-Home

## Objective

Implement `triage_submission(...)` in `core.py` - it is a pre-op triage function for a single submission package. It is currently a naive LLM-based solution that makes a real model API call. The starter implementation intentionally does not follow some best practices in using the OpenAI API. You may use whatever file structure makes sense for your solution.

Your output must match this schema:

- `decision`: `READY | NEEDS_FOLLOW_UP | NOT_CLEARED`
- `issues[]`: category + evidence (`source`, `details`)
- `explanation`

## What Is Provided

- `data/patients_sample_50.jsonl` includes:
  - `case_id`
  - `submission`
  - `expected_output`
- `run_baseline.py` runs your `triage_submission` implementation and writes outputs.
- `run_evals.py` scores outputs against provided `expected_output` and can run determinism checks.

## Completion

Note: this exercise is evaluated on engineering judgment. You may not reach a 100% score, and that is OK! We are looking to understand how you approached the problem and designed a working solution.

## Documentation

- [docs/running.md](docs/running.md) — how to run this, including what differs
  from the workflow below

- [docs/design-decisions.md](docs/design-decisions.md) — key design decisions
- [docs/assumptions.md](docs/assumptions.md) — assumptions made

## Setup

1. Confirm `uv` is installed.

```bash
uv --version
```

2. Set your OpenAI API key.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your_api_key>"
```

## Recommended Workflow

1. Implement `triage_submission` in `core.py`.
2. Run baseline outputs:

```bash
make baseline
```

3. Run eval scoring:

```bash
make evals
```

4. Run determinism check:

```bash
make determinism
```

5. Print score:

```bash
make score
```

6. View the interactive report (TUI):

```bash
make report
```

This opens a terminal UI (`view_report.py`) that shows per-case results side-by-side with oracle expectations. You can browse records, see metric pass/fail status, and inspect submission data. Press `f` on a metric row to filter the case list to failures. Press `q` to quit.

## Tests

Run the unit tests with:

```bash
make test
```

## Outputs

- Baseline outputs: `data/baseline_outputs.jsonl`
- Eval report: `data/eval_report.json`
- Determinism report: `data/determinism_report.json`

## Configurable Variables

- `MODEL` (default `gpt-4.1-mini`)
- `INPUT` (default `data/patients_sample_50.jsonl`)
- `OUTPUT` (default `data/baseline_outputs.jsonl`)
- `REPORT` (default `data/eval_report.json`)
- `DETERMINISM_REPORT` (default `data/determinism_report.json`)
